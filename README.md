* Looking at the data, the most significant titles that will be affected the most would be the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff due to this position needing employees having the most experience
* All other titles wont be affected as heavily compare to the senior roles. 

### Mentorship Eligibility 

The Mentorship Eligibility is another program that looks for employees that were born in 1965 to be a mentor to others.
* Majority of the employees that are eligible are in senior positions
* Majority of employees that are eligible started working at the company from the 1990s and later.

## Summary

Overall in order to overcome the "Silver Tsunami" At least 50000 positions would need to be filled overall. 30000 of those position should fill all Senior titles in the company in order for the company to be in a comfortable position.

With around 1500 eligible mentors and over 50000 positions that are going vacant, I believe that there are not enough to mentor the next generation. Each mentor would need to mentor 34 people at a time to be able to prepared.
